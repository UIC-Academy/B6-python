### Tuple Exercises

1.  Create a tuple `numbers` containing the integers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
2.  Access and print the third element of the `numbers` tuple.
3.  Find the length of the `numbers` tuple.
4.  Try to change the first element of `numbers` to 10. What happens?
5.  Create a tuple `fruits` with the elements 'apple', 'banana', 'cherry'.
6.  Check if 'banana' exists in the `fruits` tuple using an `if` statement.
7.  Use a `for` loop to print each fruit in the `fruits` tuple.
8.  Create a new tuple `combined` by joining `numbers` and `fruits`.
9.  Count how many times the number 3 appears in a tuple like `(1, 2, 3, 3, 4)`.
10. Unpack the tuple `('red', 'green', 'blue')` into three separate variables.
11. Create a tuple `colors` with three colors. Use a `for` loop to print each color along with its index.
12. Create a tuple with a single element, `('single',)`.
13. Write a program to find the maximum value in a tuple of numbers `(10, 5, 20, 15)`.
14. Use a `while` loop to print the elements of the tuple `('a', 'b', 'c')`.
15. Create a nested tuple `my_data = (('John', 25), ('Jane', 30))`.
16. Access and print the age of 'John' from `my_data`.
17. Convert the list `['milk', 'bread', 'eggs']` into a tuple.
18. Check if a tuple is empty using an `if` statement.
19. Write a program that takes a number and checks if it is present in the tuple `(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)`.
20. Create a tuple of squares for numbers from 1 to 5 without using a comprehension.

### Set Exercises

1.  Create a set `unique_numbers` with the elements 1, 2, 3, 4, 2. Print the set.
2.  Add the number 5 to the `unique_numbers` set.
3.  Add multiple numbers, 6 and 7, to the set.
4.  Remove the number 3 from the set.
5.  Try to remove a number that doesn't exist, like 10, using the `discard()` method.
6.  Use an `if` statement to check if the number 4 is in the set.
7.  Create two sets: `set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}` and `set2 = {3, 4, 5, 6}`.
8.  Find and print the **union** of `set1` and `set2`.
9.  Find and print the **intersection** of `set1` and `set2`.
10. Find and print the **difference** between `set1` and `set2`.
11. Convert the list `[1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4]` into a set to find all the unique numbers.
12. Use a `for` loop to iterate through a set and print each element.
13. Write a program that uses `if-else` to determine if a number is present in a set.
14. Check if `set1` is a subset of a new set `set3 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`.
15. Check if `set3` is a superset of `set1`.
16. Write a program to find the unique elements in a list `['a', 'b', 'a', 'c', 'b']` using a set.
17. Clear all elements from a set.
18. Ask a user for three of their favorite colors and store them in a set.
19. Find the symmetric difference between `set1` and `set2`.
20. Create a set of even numbers from 1 to 10.
