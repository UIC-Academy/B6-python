### Section 1: Basic `for` Loops with `range()`

1. **Count to 10:** Print numbers from 1 to 10.
2. **Countdown:** Print numbers from 10 down to 1.
3. **Even Numbers:** Print all even numbers from 2 to 20.
4. **Odd Numbers:** Print all odd numbers from 1 to 19.
5. **Multiples of 3:** Print all multiples of 3 less than or equal to 30.
6. **Sum of a Range:** Calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to 50.
7. **Average of a Range:** Calculate the average of numbers from 1 to 100.
8. **Multiplication Table:** Print the 9 times table up to 10.
9. **Factorial:** Calculate the factorial of a user-entered number (e.g., 5! = 120).
10. **Countdown with Steps:** Count down from 100 to 0, decreasing by 10 each time.

### Section 2: `for` Loops with `if/else` and `range()`

1. **Check for Positives:** Ask the user for five numbers and print "Positive" or "Not Positive" for each one.
2. **Count Vowels:** Count the number of vowels (`a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, `u`) in a user-provided string.
3. **Count Consonants:** Count the number of consonants in a user-provided string.
4. **Simple FizzBuzz:** For numbers from 1 to 20, print "Fizz" for multiples of 3, "Buzz" for multiples of 5, and "FizzBuzz" for multiples of both. Otherwise, print the number.
5. **Prime Number Check:** Ask the user for a number and use a `for` loop to determine if it is a prime number.
6. **Find Multiples:** Find and print all numbers between 1 and 100 that are divisible by both 7 and 13.
7. **Check for Uppercase:** Iterate through a string and check if it contains any uppercase letters.
8. **Count Digits:** Count the number of digits in a user-entered number.
9. **Sum of Digits:** Calculate the sum of the digits of a number.
10. **Triangle Pattern:** Print a right-aligned triangle of asterisks () with a base of 5.

### Section 3: `for` Loops with String Manipulation

1. **Print Characters:** Iterate through a string and print each character on a new line.
2. **Character Count:** Ask for a character and a string. Count how many times the character appears in the string.
3. **String Reversal:** Create a new string that is the reverse of a user-provided string.
4. **Palindrome Checker:** Check if a string is a palindrome (e.g., "madam").
5. **Remove Spaces:** Create a new string with all spaces removed from the original string.
6. **Lowercase Conversion:** Convert a string to lowercase without using built-in methods.
7. **Uppercase Conversion:** Convert a string to uppercase without using built-in methods.
8. **Word Count:** Count the number of words in a sentence, assuming words are separated by single spaces.
9. **Basic Encryption:** Shift each character in a string forward by one letter (e.g., `a` becomes `b`, `b` becomes `c`).
10. **Simple Search:** Check if a user-provided character is present in a string.

### Section 4: Advanced `for` Loops with Logic

1. **Vowel Replacer:** Replace all vowels in a string with a different character, like an asterisk ().
2. **Check for `break`:** Iterate from 1 to 100 and print the first number that is divisible by 13. Use `break` to exit the loop.
3. **Check for `continue`:** Iterate from 1 to 20. If the number is a multiple of 3, skip it and continue to the next iteration.
4. **Find Common Divisors:** Find and print the common divisors of two numbers entered by the user.
5. **Smallest Divisor:** Find the smallest divisor of a number, other than 1.
6. **Loan Repayment:** Simulate a loan repayment process. Given a principal, monthly payment, and interest rate, use a `for` loop to calculate how many months it takes to pay off the loan.
7. **Guessing Game:** Use a `for` loop to give a user a fixed number of attempts (e.g., 5) to guess a secret number.
8. **Password Check:** Use a `for` loop to give a user 3 attempts to enter the correct password.
9. **Fibonacci Sequence:** Print the first 10 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence using a loop.
10. **Number Series Sum:** Calculate the sum of a specific series, e.g., 1/1!+1/2!+1/3!+...+1/n!
