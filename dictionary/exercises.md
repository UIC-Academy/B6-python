# Python Dictionary Exercises

### Basic Operations

1.  Create a dictionary `person` with keys 'name', 'age', and 'city'.
2.  Access and print the value associated with the key 'name'.
3.  Add a new key-value pair, 'occupation', to the `person` dictionary.
4.  Change the value of the 'age' key to a new number.
5.  Remove the 'city' key-value pair from the dictionary.
6.  Check if the key 'name' exists in the dictionary.
7.  Get a list of all keys from the dictionary.
8.  Get a list of all values from the dictionary.
9.  Get a list of all key-value pairs (items) from the dictionary.
10. Create an empty dictionary and add three key-value pairs to it.

### Iteration and Comprehension

11. Iterate through the dictionary and print each key.
12. Iterate through the dictionary and print each value.
13. Iterate through the dictionary and print each key and its corresponding value.
14. Use a **dictionary comprehension** to create a dictionary with numbers as keys (1 to 5) and their squares as values.
15. Use a dictionary comprehension to create a dictionary from a list of words, where the keys are the words and the values are the lengths of the words.
16. Create a dictionary from two lists, one for keys and one for values.
17. Merge two dictionaries into one.

### Nested Dictionaries

18. Create a dictionary `students` where each key is a student's name and the value is another dictionary containing their 'math' and 'science' scores.
19. Access and print the science score of a specific student.
20. Add a new subject, 'history', and its score for one of the students.
21. Iterate through the `students` dictionary and print each student's name and their average score.

### Advanced Operations & Techniques

22. Get the number of key-value pairs in the dictionary.
23. Create a **copy** of a dictionary.
24. Use the `get()` method to access a key, providing a default value if the key doesn't exist.
25. Use the `setdefault()` method to add a new key only if it doesn't already exist.
26. Count the frequency of characters in a string and store them in a dictionary.
27. Count the frequency of words in a sentence and store them in a dictionary.
28. **Invert** a dictionary, so that the values become keys and the keys become values (handle duplicate values by storing them in a list).
29. Sort a dictionary by its keys and print the sorted dictionary.
30. Sort a dictionary by its values and print the sorted dictionary.

### Problem Solving

31. Write a function that takes a dictionary and returns `True` if all values are unique, otherwise returns `False`.
32. Find the key with the maximum value in a dictionary.
33. Find the key with the minimum value in a dictionary.
34. Remove all key-value pairs where the value is an empty string.
35. Create a dictionary where keys are numbers from 1 to 10 and values are 'even' or 'odd'.
36. Given a list of dictionaries, find the dictionary with the highest value for a specific key.
37. Use `pop()` to remove a specific key and return its value.
38. **Zip** two lists, one for keys and one for values, to create a dictionary.
39. Write a function that takes a dictionary and a list of keys to remove. Remove the specified keys from the dictionary.
40. Check if two dictionaries are **equal**.
