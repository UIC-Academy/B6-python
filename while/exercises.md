### Section 1: Basic `while` Loop and `if/else`

1. **Count to 10:** Write a program that uses a `while` loop to print numbers from 1 to 10.
2. **Countdown:** Write a program that counts down from 10 to 1.
3. **Even Numbers:** Print all even numbers from 2 to 20.
4. **Odd Numbers:** Print all odd numbers from 1 to 19.
5. **Multiples of 5:** Print all multiples of 5 less than or equal to 50.
6. **User Input Loop:** Prompt the user to enter a number and keep asking until they enter 0.
7. **Positive Numbers Only:** Ask the user for a number. If it's negative, ask again. Keep asking until a positive number is entered.
8. **Secret Number:** Use a `while` loop to let the user guess a secret number (e.g., 7). Print "Too high!" or "Too low!" until they guess correctly.
9. **Simple Calculator:** Use a loop to perform simple calculations. Ask the user for two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /). Print the result. Continue until the user enters 'q' to quit.
10. **Password Check:** Prompt the user for a password. Use a `while` loop to give them **three attempts**. If they get it right, print a success message. If not, print a failure message.

### Section 2: `while` Loop with Counters and Accumulators

1. **Sum of First 10 Numbers:** Use a `while` loop to calculate the sum of the numbers from 1 to 10.
2. **Average of 5 Numbers:** Prompt the user to enter five numbers and calculate their average using a `while` loop.
3. **Factorial:** Calculate the factorial of a number entered by the user. (e.g., 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)
4. **Count Digits:** Count the number of digits in an integer entered by the user.
5. **Reverse a Number:** Reverse a number entered by the user (e.g., 123 becomes 321).
6. **Sum of Digits:** Calculate the sum of the digits of a number entered by the user.
7. **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD):** Find the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm with a `while` loop.
8. **Fibonacci Sequence:** Print the first 10 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence (0, 1, 1, 2, 3...).
9. **Triangle Perimeter:** Ask the user for three lengths. Check if they can form a valid triangle using `if` statements (sum of any two sides must be greater than the third). Keep asking until they enter valid lengths.
10. **Bank Account:** Simulate a simple bank account. Start with a balance of $100. Use a `while` loop to let the user deposit or withdraw money. The loop should stop if the balance drops below $0.

### Section 3: `while` Loop with String Manipulation

1. **Count Vowels:** Count the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in a string entered by the user.
2. **Count Consonants:** Count the number of consonants in a string.
3. **String Reversal:** Reverse a string entered by the user.
4. **Palindrome Checker:** Check if a string is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward).
5. **Remove Whitespace:** Remove all spaces from a string entered by the user.
6. **First Vowel:** Find the index of the first vowel in a string.
7. **Character Counter:** Count how many times a specific character (e.g., 'a') appears in a string.
8. **String Truncation:** Ask the user for a string and a maximum length. Truncate the string if it's longer than the max length, adding "..." to the end.
9. **Basic Encryption:** Shift each character in a string forward by one letter (a->b, b->c, etc.).
10. **Simple Search:** Check if a substring exists within a larger string.

### Section 4: Advanced `while` Loop with Logic

1. **Prime Number Checker:** Determine if a number entered by the user is a **prime number**.
2. **Guessing Game (Limited Guesses):** Similar to exercise 8, but give the user a limited number of guesses (e.g., 5).
3. **Rock, Paper, Scissors:** Create a simple game against the computer. The user and the computer make a choice, and the winner is determined. Play until the user decides to quit.
4. **Collatz Conjecture:** For a given number, if it's even, divide it by 2. If it's odd, multiply by 3 and add 1. Repeat until the number is 1. Print the sequence.
5. **Number Guessing Game with Range:** The computer picks a random number within a range (e.g., 1-100). The user has to guess it, and the computer gives hints ("Too high," "Too low").
6. **Loan Repayment Calculator:** Calculate how many months it will take to pay off a loan given a principal amount, interest rate, and monthly payment.
7. **Positive Input Loop:** Write a program that repeatedly asks the user for a number and adds it to a total. The loop should stop when the user enters a **negative number**, and then print the total.
8. **Vending Machine Simulation:** Simulate a simple vending machine. The user enters money. The machine should dispense an item if the money is sufficient and give change. Loop until the user is done.
9. **Simple Text Menu:** Display a menu with options (e.g., 1. Add, 2. Subtract, 3. Quit). Use a `while` loop to keep the menu active until the user chooses to quit.
10. **Dice Rolling Game:** Simulate rolling a pair of dice. Keep rolling until both dice show the same number (a "double"). Print the results of each roll.
