# Lists Exercises

**Fundamentals & Creation:**

1. Create a list of your 5 favorite fruits.
2. Create a list of the numbers from 1 to 10.
3. Create an empty list called `my_shopping_cart`.
4. Access the third item in a given list.
5. Print the last item of a list using a negative index.
6. Print the first three items of a list using slicing.
7. Create a new list that contains a slice of the original list from the 4th item to the 8th.
8. Check if a specific fruit is in your list of favorite fruits using an `if` statement.

**Modification & Manipulation:**

1. Add "grapes" to the end of your fruit list.
2. Insert "mango" at the second position of your fruit list.
3. Change the first item in your fruit list to "kiwi".
4. Remove the last item from your fruit list using `.pop()`.
5. Remove "apple" from your fruit list using `.remove()`.
6. Empty the entire list of fruits.
7. Create a list of names and a list of ages. Extend the names list with the ages list.
8. Create a copy of a list and modify the copy without affecting the original.

**Iteration & Loops:**

1. Use a `for` loop to print each fruit in your fruit list.
2. Use a `while` loop to print each number from 1 to 5 from a list.
3. Iterate through a list of strings and print only the ones that contain the letter 'a'.
4. Iterate through a list of numbers and print only the even numbers.
5. Find the sum of all numbers in a list using a loop.
6. Find the largest number in a list without using the built-in `max()` function.
7. Count how many times "banana" appears in a list.

**List Comprehension (Advanced for Beginners):**

1. Use a list comprehension to create a new list containing the squares of numbers from 1 to 10.
2. Use a list comprehension to filter a list of words, keeping only those with more than 5 characters.
3. Use a list comprehension to convert all strings in a list to uppercase.

**Combining Concepts:**

1. Create a list of sentences. Use a loop to print each sentence along with its length.
2. Create a list of mixed data types (e.g., strings, numbers, booleans).
3. Reverse a list without using the built-in `.reverse()` method.
4. Given two lists, create a third list containing only the items that are present in both.
5. Remove all duplicate items from a list.
6. Sort a list of strings alphabetically.
7. Sort a list of numbers in descending order.

9. Create a list of five user-entered names.
10. Ask the user for a number, then create a list containing that many zeros.
11. Split a string into a list of words.
12. Join a list of words into a single string with spaces in between.
13. Write a program that takes a list of grades and prints the average.
14. Write a program that asks the user for numbers until they enter "done," then stores all numbers in a list and prints them.
